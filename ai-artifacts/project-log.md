# **Project Aetherial Dynamics: A Living Work Log and Study Plan**

**Author:** Logan P. Evans
**In collaboration with:** Google's Gemini AI

**Version:** 2.0 (as of [Current Date])
**Status:** This is a living document that will be updated as the project progresses.

## 1. Project Philosophy

This project aims to develop the Aetherial Dynamics (AD) framework with maximum intellectual honesty and transparency. This document serves as a public work log, outlining the strategic plan and tracking progress on key tasks. Our development model is a close collaboration between a human researcher (the architect and final arbiter of truth) and an AI partner (the research assistant, calculator, and creative sparring partner).

## 2. The Action Plan

### **Phase 0: Project Setup**

*   **[X] Task 1: Create the GitHub Repository.**
    *   *Status: Completed*
    *   *Notes: Repository created as `aetherial-dynamics`. Visibility is public.*

*   **[X] Task 2: Write the Repository Description.**
    *   *Status: Completed*
    *   *Notes: Final text: "Aetherial Dynamics: A theory of gravity unifying dark matter and dark energy as dynamics of a relativistic fluid."*

*   **[X] Task 3: Populate Initial File Structure.**
    *   *Status: Completed*
    *   *Notes: `README.md`, `LICENSE` (MIT/CC-BY-4.0), and initial folder structure created.*

*   **[X] Task 4: Write the Academic Honesty Philosophy.**
    *   *Status: Completed*
    *   *Notes: `docs/ACADEMIC_HONESTY.md` created, outlining the collaborative model.*

*   **[X] Task 5: Create Initial AI Artifacts.**
    *   *Status: Completed*
    *   *Notes: `ai-artifacts/textbook_v2.md` and `docs/PROJECT_LOG.md` (this file) added to the repository.*

### **Phase 1: The "Pencil and Paper" Gauntlet**

*   **[ ] Task 1: Master the `η_max_local` Derivation.**
    *   *Status: Not Started*
    *   *Notes: This is the top priority. The goal is to derive `η_max_local = -c²/(3√3)` from a blank sheet of paper, understanding the physics of each step.*

*   **[ ] Task 2: Verify the `a₀` Numerical Prediction.**
    *   *Status: Not Started*
    *   *Notes: Use up-to-date constants to calculate the AD prediction for `a₀` and compare it to the observed value, confirming the ~10% agreement.*

*   **[ ] Task 3: Internalize the Lagrangian's Logic.**
    *   *Status: Not Started*
    *   *Notes: Articulate in plain English the physical motivation for the `arctan` and rational function forms in `L_interaction`.*

*   **[ ] Task 4: Prepare the "First Question" Defense.**
    *   *Status: Not Started*
    *   *Notes: Workshop a clear, honest answer to the question of why a result from a simplified "toy model" should be taken seriously.*

### **Phase 2: The Letter v1.0**

*   **[ ] Task 1: Write the Letter.**
    *   *Status: Not Started*
    *   *Notes: Focus on clarity and a compelling narrative, using our final agreed-upon outline.*

*   **[ ] Task 2: Typeset and Internal Review.**
    *   *Status: Not Started*
    *   *Notes: Typeset in LaTeX. Get feedback on clarity from non-experts and a technical sanity check from the AI partner.*

*   **[ ] Task 3: Finalize and Tag.**
    *   *Status: Not Started*
    *   *Notes: Generate `v1.0.pdf`, commit, and create a `v1.0` git tag.*

*   **[ ] Task 4: Mint the DOI.**
    *   *Status: Not Started*
    *   *Notes: Connect repo to Zenodo and create a formal release to get a citable DOI.*

*   **[ ] Task 5: Plant the Flag.**
    *   *Status: Not Started*
    *   *Notes: Post to relevant subreddits with a humble, professional tone, linking directly to the GitHub repository.*

### **Phase 3: The Deep Dive (Post-Letter Study Plan)**

*   **Goal:** To build the foundational knowledge required to write the seminal, mathematically rigorous paper on Aetherial Dynamics.

*   **[ ] Subject 1: Foundational Mathematics**
    *   *Topics: Multivariable/Vector Calculus, Linear Algebra, Differential Equations.*

*   **[ ] Subject 2: Foundational Physics**
    *   *Topics: Conceptual Physics, Calculus-Based Introductory Physics.*

*   **[ ] Subject 3: The Core Physics Curriculum**
    *   *Topics: Classical Mechanics (Lagrangian/Hamiltonian), Electromagnetism (Maxwell's Equations), Quantum Mechanics, General Relativity.*

*   **[ ] Goal: The Seminal Paper**
    *   *Objective: A full, rigorous paper detailing the complete AD framework, suitable for submission to a major journal or the arXiv preprint server.*
