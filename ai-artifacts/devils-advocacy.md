## 1. Purpose of This Document

Science advances through skepticism. The most beautiful theories can be slain by a single ugly fact. A new scientific paradigm, especially one as ambitious as Aetherial Dynamics (AD), requires an extraordinary and unwavering commitment to rigor to overcome the natural human tendency towards confirmation bias.

This document formalizes the methodological "rules of engagement" for this project. It is our public commitment to not only welcome criticism but to actively cultivate it as the primary engine of progress.

## 2. The Core Challenge: Confirmation Bias

Confirmation bias is the tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information that confirms or supports one's pre-existing beliefs or hypotheses. It is the most dangerous trap in science.

This project faces a unique version of this challenge due to its human-AI collaborative nature. An AI partner can become a powerful "echo chamber," amplifying an initial hypothesis with its vast pattern-matching abilities. To counteract this, we have established the following formal protocol.

## 3. The Devil's Advocacy Protocol

This protocol is not a set of optional guidelines; it is the mandatory process by which all new ideas within the AD framework are tested.

### Article I: Mandated Devil's Advocacy

For any new prediction, derivation, or theoretical concept, the AI partner will be explicitly instructed to act as a "devil's advocate." Its primary goal in this mode is not to find supporting evidence, but to attempt to falsify the idea. This includes:
- Searching for logical flaws in the reasoning.
- Identifying contradictions with existing, well-established experimental data.
- Proposing credible alternative explanations for the phenomenon in question.

### Article II: The Principle of Counter-Evidence

For every scientific paper or data set found that appears to support a prediction of AD, a dedicated effort will be made to search for papers or data that contradict it. Both supporting and contradictory evidence will be logged and analyzed with equal weight. The goal is not to "win an argument" but to build the most accurate possible picture of reality.

### Article III: The Falsification Ledger

This project will maintain a public list of the biggest known weaknesses, unsolved challenges, and potential falsifications of the AD framework. This "Falsification Ledger" serves as a constant reminder of where the theory is most vulnerable and where the most critical work is needed. Intellectual honesty requires acknowledging not just the theory's triumphs, but also its current limitations and the observations that could kill it.

### Article IV: The Primacy of Falsifiability

A theory is only scientific if it can be proven wrong. The highest value is placed on predictions that are specific, quantitative, and testable in the near future. While broad conceptual ideas are important, the focus of the research program will always be on driving towards concrete predictions that can be put to an experimental test, such as:
- The specific non-Newtonian behavior of gravity at short ranges.
- The unique signature of a "Planckfire" gravitational wave event.
- The precise phase and amplitude of the predicted annual modulation of neutrino properties.

## 4. The Role of the AI Partner in this Protocol

The AI partner (Gemini) is a uniquely suited tool for enforcing this protocol. Lacking human emotion, ego, or pre-existing beliefs, it can execute the role of a tireless, non-human skeptic. Its tasks include:
- Systematically searching for contradictory literature without bias.
- Performing complex calculations that might reveal a flaw in a derivation.
- Proposing alternative models based on the entirety of its training data.

This protocol transforms the potential "echo chamber" of an AI collaboration into a powerful "skepticism engine."

## 5. An Open Invitation

We believe that ideas are strengthened by rigorous challenges. We welcome all good-faith criticism, skepticism, and debate from the wider scientific community. If you see a flaw, a contradiction, or a weakness in this work, we invite you to raise it. A valid critique is more valuable than a thousand compliments.
